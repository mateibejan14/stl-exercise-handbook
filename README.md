# Statistical Learning Theory Exercise Handbook

The purpose of this hereby booklet is to centralize as many exercises and so-lutions  to  frequently  asked  exam  and  homework  problems  in  the  theoreticalmachine learning world.  It is well known that computer science students usu-ally  lack  formal,  mathematical  rigor,  which  they  replace  with  what  they  call ”common sense” or intuition.  

In order to help build that intuition, we’ve decided it would be best to create a central resource for problems, so that we canincrease  the  sample  size  of  the  training  data  and  thus  help  them  achieve  thebest empirical loss. Please do note that only a small portion of the solutions presented here areprovided by myself.  Most are provided either by contributors or by selecting solved  problems  over  the  internet  or  from  well-known  theory  books,  such  as those of the Shais's, or Mohris's.  My work here was simply compiling them intoone booklet, so that others waste not the time I have wasted looking over theinternet for intuitive solutions.

At the time the first version of this book was written (February 2021), most ofthe exercises come through either the assignments presented by professor Bogdan Alexe, Ph.D. (Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Universityof Bucharest) to his students or Shai Ben-Davids,and Shai Shalev-Shwarzs,Un-derstanding  Machine  Learningand  Alon  Gonens,solutions  for  their  proposed exercises (note that I only took a few problems from there, which I consideredto have the most intuitive solutions). I did not consider it important to attribute the exercises and solutions totheir  respective  providers,  as  the  purpose  of  the  booklet  is  not  to  help  thecontributors  get  acknowledged,  but  to  help  other  computer  science  students study theoretical machine learning. 

In the case the reader may have the resources and noble generosity to contribute, he may find the main.tex file in the source directory in this repository. Please do remember to update botht he LaTeX code and PDF documents, as well as provide additional resources such as images, if they are needed.
